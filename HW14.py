import time
#1. Create a for loop with variable i that counts down from 5 to 1 and then prints "Hello World!"
#at the end.
x = 5
for i in range(1,5+1):
    print(x)
    x -= 1
    time.sleep(1)
print("hellow world")
#2. Create a for loop that counts up and prints only even numbers between 1 and 30.
for i in range(1,30+1):
    if i % 2 == 0:
        print(i)
#3. Create a for loop that prints from 1 to 30 and continues (skips the number) if the number is
#divisible by 3.
for i in range(1,30+1):
    if i % 3 != 0:
        print(i)
#4. Create a for loop that prints 5 different animals from a list.
anims = ["dog","cat","bird","goat","monkey"]
for anim in anims:
    print(anim)
#5. Create a for loop that spells out a word you input backwards.
#(HINT: Google "How to reverse a string in Python")
for i in str(input("put a word here: "))[::-1]:
    print(i)
#6. Create a list containing 10 integers of your choice and print the list.
#ints = []
#for i in range(1,10+1):
#    ints.append(int(input("enter number: ")))
#    print(i,"out of 10 made")
#print(ints)
ints_new = [6,7,6,7,6,7,6,7,6,7,6,7,7]
print(ints_new)
#7. Create two empty variables named evenNumbers and oddNumbers.
evenNumbers = 0
oddNumbers = 0
#8. Make a loop that counts the number of even and odd numbers in the list, and prints the
#result after the loop.
for i in ints_new:
    if i % 2 == 0:
        evenNumbers += 1
    else:
        oddNumbers += 1
print("even numbers:",evenNumbers,"odd numbers:", oddNumbers)
#9. Create a variable that asks the user for an integer and an empty integer variable.
asked = int(input("put a number here: "))
empty = 1
#10. Create a loop with a range from 1 to the number the user input. Use the loop to find the
#factorial of that number and print the result. A factorial of a number is that number multiplied
#by every number before it until you reach 1. (For example: 5! is 5 x 4 x 3 x 2 x 1 = 120)
for i in range(1,asked+1):
    empty *= i
print(empty)
