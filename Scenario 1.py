#Assignment: Scenario 1

#Scenario 1:
#You are a programmer for a fledgling game developer. Your team lead has asked you
#to create a nested dictionary containing five enemy creatures (and their properties)
#for combat testing. Additionally, the testers are asking for a way to input changes
#to the enemy's damage values for balancing, as well as having it print those changes
#to confirm they went through.
